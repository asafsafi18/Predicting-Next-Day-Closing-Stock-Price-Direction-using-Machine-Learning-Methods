# Predicting-Next-Day-Closing-Stock-Price-Direction-using-Machine-Learning-Methods
Stock price prediction is a priority goal of every investor or trader, so it enables them to reduce risks and increase profits by analyzing past records. This paper focuses on the best independent variables and indicators to predict next-day closing stock price direction using machine learning methods. Different machine learning techniques include Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using RBF kernel, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost are applied to foresee the stock price of Apple. The models performance would be compared using two metrics, Accuracy, and AUC (Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Experiment results suggest that the Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers are more fitting for Predicting the Next Day Closing Stock Price Trend.
